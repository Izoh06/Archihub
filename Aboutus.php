                     <hr>
                     <p>Problem areas are prostulated. This helps determine the boundaries of all subsequent investigation.The boundaries are not sacrosanct as subsequent work may well uncover facts which will disturb the original genesis of the project.</p>

                     <hr>
                     <p>This includes the gathering of all relevant information. During this stage we also review existing examples or phenomena. The selections of what to observe, and how to record the observations is done with skill and objectivity.</p>

                     <hr>
                     <p>In this stage, the results of observations, in terms of data collection, fact riding, and areas of success, failure orredudancy are accessed, sometimes by statistical processes. This allows the problem to be reduced to manageable proportions.</p>

                     <hr>
                     <p>After reviewing the colleated information, we frame hypothesis. This involves the development of a theory leading to a useful classification of consistent aims.Testing of hypothesis, by means of optical or mathematical models is usually undertaken.These may well suggest further questions at this stage, and require backtracking to the first stage</p>
